The FBI were mad sus, and failed to close the cases relating to the protagonist's family. But he set out on a riveting tale of mystery, love, and murder. This book is a must read if you're a crime thriller connoisseur.",

      "review": "This book is completely misleading. The entire plot revolves around finding Baby's belly button; the title makes this much clear from the beginning. However, there is no mystery. There is no twist. Baby's belly button is right where it's supposed to be, on Baby's stomach. Right where it clearly shows you it is on the cover of the book. The plot is a complete mess as a result of it's reliance on the mystery of where the belly button is; everything falls apart the second you realize that the belly button was in plain sight all along. There is no conflict, there is no character development, and there is scarcely any plot. Whoever wrote this book must have serious error in judgement, because you would have to be an infant to not immediately understand where Baby's belly button is. This is one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read.",

Why would anyone write a book on life after death? A bunch of blank pages? I would give this a solid yelp review of 2/5. *The blank pages were good for a fire*",
